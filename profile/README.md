# ArchieOS
ArchieOS is an experiment of using archiso and package some applications that may be helpful for game developing.
It aims to be a light user-friendly distro, featuring Plasma as a desktop environment (for now), Firefox as it's default web browser and some programs for manipulation and creation of graphics such as Krita and Inkscape. There's a lot to do, but first step is to make it usable.
